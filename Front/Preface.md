# Preface

Updating the software in Embedded Devices especially after the production and distribution of the product is not an easy task, In fact it’s rarely heard of except for High-Risk [^fn1] product like in Satellites, Space-rovers, Aircrafts, Automotive and heavy machinery Or media devices with internet, computer access like Smart TVs, Media Players and Cell-Phones.  

[^fn1]: High Risk imposed by Software bugs.  

This is as result of a oblivion of a standard programming interface for microcontrollers, The fragmentation in the programming interfaces in a single MCU [^fn2] manufacturer is vast not to mention custom MCU.

[^fn2]: Microcontroller‎.

So, Why the need to update firmwares, firmwares are software and as all software there always a bug somewhere, but with regular software it's easy to push a new version or patches that fixes it as but for devices with embedded system that have been distributed is the very hight cost and hard to reach all distributed devices courtesy of global market.

With that in mind, we need an easy way to update software for this embedded device even for Household devices like Microwave-Ovens, Refrigerator, Washing Machines, ..etc, any device with an embedded system.

So, we developed an API [^fn3] to easy the process of including an easy way to update the firmware without the complex programmer interface and software of the MCU, A war to allow developer update there firmware over universal interfaces link USB, SD Cards, Ethernet, ..etc.

[^fn3]: Application Programming Interface.
